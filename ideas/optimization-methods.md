# Optimization methods

- Canonical Genetic Algorithm -> no so simple for beginners
- Simulated Annealing -> good entry point
- Monte Carlo (Markov Chain and Importance sampling) -> aaah! need a good article plan
- Neighborhood Algorithm -> not so easy to implement
- Simple Gradient Descent -> easy to implement and to understand
- Adjoint State .... yes but no...but yes
